============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/guoguo12/billboard-charts.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/guoguo12/billboard-charts)

**billboard.py** is a Python API for accessing music charts from [Billboard.com](http://www.billboard.com/charts/).

Installation
------------

Install with pip:

```
pip install billboard.py
```

Or clone this repo and run `python setup.py install`.

Quickstart
----------

To download a *Billboard* chart, we use the `ChartData()` constructor.

Let's fetch the current [Hot 100](http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100) chart.

```Python
>>> import billboard
>>> chart = billboard.ChartData('hot-100')
>>> chart.title
'The Hot 100'
```

Now we can look at the chart entries, which are of type `ChartEntry` and have attributes like `artist` and `title`:

```Python
>>> song = chart[0]  # Get no. 1 song on chart
>>> song.title
'Nice For What'
>>> song.artist
'Drake'
>>> song.weeks  # Number of weeks on chart
2
```

We can also `print` the entire chart:

```
>>> print(chart)
hot-100 chart from 2018-04-28
-----------------------------
1. 'Nice For What' by Drake
2. 'God's Plan' by Drake
3. 'Meant To Be' by Bebe Rexha & Florida Georgia Line
4. 'Psycho' by Post Malone Featuring Ty Dolla $ign
5. 'The Middle' by Zedd, Maren Morris & Grey
# ...
```

Guide

### Listing all charts

Use the `charts` function to list all chart names:

```Python
>>> billboard.charts()
['hot-100', 'billboard-200', 'artist-100', 'social-50', ...
```

The bottom of [this page](https://www.billboard.com/charts) shows all charts grouped by category.

*Billboard* also publishes [year-end charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Year-End). List these by passing `year_end=True` to the `charts` function:

```python
>>> billboard.charts(year_end=True)
['top-artists', 'top-artists-duo-group', 'top-artists-female', ...
```

You can also find them [here](https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end).

### Downloading a chart

Use the `ChartData` constructor to download a chart:

```Python
ChartData(name, date=None, year=None, fetch=True, timeout=25)
```

The arguments are:

* `name` &ndash; The chart name, e.g. `'hot-100'` or `'pop-songs'`.
* `date` &ndash; The chart date as a string, in YYYY-MM-DD format. By default, the latest chart is fetched.
* `year` &ndash; The chart year, if requesting a year-end chart. Must be a string in YYYY format. Cannot supply both `date` and `year`.
* `fetch` &ndash; A boolean indicating whether to fetch the chart data from Billboard.com immediately (at instantiation time). If `False`, the chart data can be populated at a later time using the `fetchEntries()` method.
* `max_retries` &ndash; The max number of times to retry when requesting data (default: 5).
* `timeout` &ndash; The number of seconds to wait for a server response. If `None`, no timeout is applied.

For example, to download the [Alternative Songs year-end chart for 2006](https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2006/alternative-songs):

```python	
>>> chart = billboard.ChartData('alternative-songs', year=2006)
```

### Walking through chart dates

Every `ChartData` instance has a `previousDate` attribute containing a string representation of the previous chart's date. You can feed this into another `ChartData` instance to effectively walk back through previous charts.

```python
chart = billboard.ChartData('hot-100')
while chart.previousDate:
    doSomething(chart)
    chart = billboard.ChartData('hot-100', chart.previousDate)
```

Year-end charts have `previousYear` (and `nextYear`) instead.

### Accessing chart entries

If `chart` is a `ChartData` instance, we can ask for its `entries` attribute to get the chart entries (see below) as a list.

For convenience, `chart[x]` is equivalent to `chart.entries[x]`, and `ChartData` instances are iterable.

### Chart entry attributes

A chart entry (typically a single track) is of type `ChartEntry`. A `ChartEntry` instance has the following attributes:

* `title` &ndash; The title of the track.
* `artist` &ndash; The name of the artist, as formatted on Billboard.com.
* `image` &ndash; The URL of the image for the track.
* `peakPos` &ndash; The track's peak position on the chart as of the chart date, as an int (or `None` if the chart does not include this information).
* `lastPos` &ndash; The track's position on the previous week's chart, as an int (or `None` if the chart does not include this information). This value is 0 if the track was not on the previous week's chart.
* `weeks` &ndash; The number of weeks the track has been or was on the chart, including future dates (up until the present time).
* `rank` &ndash; The track's current position on the chart.
* `isNew` &ndash; Whether the track is new to the chart.
